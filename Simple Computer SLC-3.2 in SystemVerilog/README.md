# Simple Computer SLC-3.2 in SystemVerilog

Overview:-
The SLC-3.2 is a simplified LC-3 processor implemented on FPGA. It executes a fetch-decode-execute cycle, performs arithmetic and logic operations, handles memory-mapped I/O, and provides visual cues using LEDs and hex displays. It is designed for educational purposes to understand processor architecture, control logic, and hardware-software interaction.

Function:-
- Executes instructions: ADD, ADDi, AND, ANDi, NOT, BR, JMP, JSR, LDR, STR, PAUSE.
- Handles memory-mapped I/O for switches and hex displays.
- Provides visual feedback using LEDs for program progress.
- Implements a multi-cycle fetch-decode-execute cycle.
